=== GIT Repo Sync ===


1. Clone Assembla repo to "/home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer"

2. Setup github as a remote with name "github"

3. Add a script called "pushpull.sh" to "/home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer" with contents:

  #!/bin/sh
  git pull origin master
  git push -u github master

4. Use "crontab -e" to add task that runs every 5 mins:

  0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * cd /home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer; ./pullpush.sh
