=== GIT Repo Sync ===

While the main GIT repo is held on Assembla, a version of it is kept updated on GITHub. This is for convenience of those that prefer GITHub. This documents how the automatic pull/push is done on a local development server (it's quite dumb really) in case we need to duplicate it again:

1. Clone Assembla repo to "/home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer"

2. Setup github as a remote with name "github" in that pull

3. Add a script called "pushpull.sh" to "/home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer" with contents:

  #!/bin/sh
  git pull origin master
  git push -u github master

4. Make above executable for user script will run as (ideally this was all setup as someone with low/no privileges since they need no access elsewhere).

5. Use "crontab -e" to add task that runs every 5 mins and runs that script:

  0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * cd /home/someone/somewhere/chipwhisperer; ./pullpush.sh
