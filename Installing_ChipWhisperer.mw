This page describes how to install the ChipWhisperer software. 

There are four ways to set up ChipWhisperer:

* '''ChipWhisperer Releases:''' Get a zip file with the latest stable ChipWhisperer code and run it on your own environment. 
* '''PyPi Package:''' <code>pip install chipwhisperer</code>. Only includes the software - doesn't come with the hardware source files.
* '''Git Repository:''' Get the latest, bleeding-edge features and bugs. Recommended if you're an experienced developer and you want to contribute to ChipWhisperer.
