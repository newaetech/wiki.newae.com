== Hardware Description ==
This target board is designed to experiment with the MSP430FR5969 (which has hardware AES), and MSP430FR5869 (without hardware AES). The same footprint can be used with both parts - the MSP430FR5869 has the advantage of being easier to export due to a lack of cryptographic modules present.

The device can be programmed with an external programmer using JTAG or Spy-Bi-Wire, or from the ChipWhisperer software using the serial BSL (Bootstrap Loader). Using BSL requires an entry sequence that can be generated by ChipWhisperer-Capture hardware.

==Build Environment==

The examples are designed to be built with GCC for the MSP430 (msp430-elf-gcc). You can download a build of GCC from [http://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-gcc-opensource TI's website], although you may also have a build from another location. Downloading from TI will require registering & agreeing to some export control conditions. The following assumes you have installed this version of GCC.

If you want to use an external programmer, you can also download a [http://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-flasher Command-Line MSP430Flasher program].

=== Include File Location ===

Currently, the provided GCC does not seem to add the MSP430 header files as a default include location. Instead you must specify the location of these files in the Makefile - on Windows for example this defaults to <code>C:\ti\msp430_gcc\include</code> . You will see one of the first lines of the Makefile specifies this path:
 INC_PATH = C:/ti/msp430_gcc/include/

=== Batch File for Building ===
When running make, you'll need to have the msp430-gcc files on your system path. Rather than modifying your path, you may wish to make a batch file with the path on it. For Windows you can call this file <code>tigcc.bat</code>, and for example the following shows including both GCC and the flasher program:
 set PATH=%PATH%;C:\ti\msp430_gcc\bin;C:\ti\MSPFlasher_1.3.10<br>
 cmd
Double-clicking on this file should give you a command prompt which now has tools like <code>make</code> and <code>msp430-elf-gcc</code> in the path:
