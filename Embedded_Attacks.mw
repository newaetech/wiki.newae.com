This is a landing page for a couple of different things. It shows some of the attacks and projects that are possible through side channel analysis, including some examples that have been done with the ChipWhisperer.

= Tools =

Note that ChipWhisperer isn't the only side-channel analysis project out there! You'd be a fool for not checking out these other great projects:

* [https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels Side Channel Marvels] Includes a number of tools. This includes a higher-order CPA tool (which supports distributed use). The binary format used by the higher-order CPA tool can be exported from ChipWhisperer traces (see [[File Format]] page).

* [http://opensca.sourceforge.net/ OpenSCA] is a MATLAB tool-box full of SCA goodies & examples. Again you can export ChipWhisperer traces to this format.

* [http://dpacontest.org/ DPAContest] isn't strictly a project per-say, but it includes a lot of useful examples of attacks, capture tools, etc. Again a great resource.

= General Embedded Attacks (Side-Channel & Others) =

[[IEEE 802.15.4 Radio Attacks]]

[[AES Bootloader Attack]]

[[TI ChipCon SRAM Dump]]

= Example Attacks with ChipWhisperer =

These links aren't exactly tutorials - they're examples of what can be done using the ChipWhisperer. However, it should be possible to reproduce most of these results with the ChipWhisperer hardware given a bit of time and creativity.

[[Atmel XMEGA Hardware AES Attack]]

[[Atmel ATmega128RFA1 Hardware AES Attack]]

[[TI CC2530 Hardware AES Attack]]

[[Attacking TEA with CPA]]

[[Investigating Block Cipher Modes with DPA]]

[[AES-CCM Attack]]

= Other Project Ideas =

These are examples that didn't get completed. They might make fun projects if you're looking for new ways to use your ChipWhisperer.
