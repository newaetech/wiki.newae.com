== Tools ==

Note that ChipWhisperer isn't the only side-channel analysis project out there! You'd be a fool for not checking out these other great projects:

* [https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels Side Channel Marvels] Includes a number of tools. This includes a higher-order CPA tool (which supports distributed use). The binary format used by the higher-order CPA tool can be exported from ChipWhisperer traces (see [[File Format]] page).

* [http://opensca.sourceforge.net/ OpenSCA] is a MATLAB tool-box full of SCA goodies & examples. Again you can export ChipWhisperer traces to this format.

* [http://dpacontest.org/ DPAContest] isn't strictly a project per-say, but it includes a lot of useful examples of attacks, capture tools, etc. Again a great resource.
