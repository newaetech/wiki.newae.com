This board supports the Atmel SAM4L microcontroller. The default build has the Atmel ATSAM4LC2AA-AU, which has 128KB flash and 32KB SRAM.

== Hardware AES ==

The SAM4L has a hardware AES module, with optional countermeasures that can be enabled.

== Programming ==

An external programmer is needed for this target. The SAM4L has an internal bootloader you can use via an external serial port, which is not yet supported directly by the ChipWhisperer-Capture software.

=== JTAG Programmer ===

The 20-pin JTAG port (J6 on CW308 Board) can be used with the [https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATATMEL-ICE/ATATMEL-ICE-ND/4753379 ATATMEL-ICE] which is Atmel's JTAG programmer. You can use any other ARM programmer you might have as well (i.e., OpenOCD, Segger J-Link, etc).

=== Using Atmel SAM-BA ===

Atmel SAM4L has a built-in bootloader. Not this bootloader is NOT ROM-Resident - if you reprogram the device the bootloader is lost, since it is stored in flash memory. It is recommended to use an external JTAG programmer for this target, as since the bootloader is not ROM-resident it can easily be overwritten by accident (i.e., if connecting a JTAG programmer).

== Schematic ==

See GIT Repo for PDF of schematic.
