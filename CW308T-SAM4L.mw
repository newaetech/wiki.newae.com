== Hardware AES ==

The SAM4L has a hardware AES module, with optional countermeasures that can be enabled.

== Programming ==

An external programmer is needed for this target. The SAM4L has an internal bootloader you can use via an external serial port, which is not yet supported directly by the ChipWhisperer-Capture software.

=== JTAG Programmer ===

The 20-pin JTAG port (J6 on CW308 Board) can be used with the [https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATATMEL-ICE/ATATMEL-ICE-ND/4753379 ATATMEL-ICE] which is Atmel's JTAG programmer. You can use any other ARM programmer you might have as well (i.e., OpenOCD, Segger J-Link, etc).

=== Using Atmel SAM-BA ===

Atmel SAM-BA is a built-in bootloader. Not this bootloader is NOT ROM-Resident - if you reprogram the device the bootloader is lost, since it is stored in flash memory.

== Schematic ==

See GIT Repo for PDF of schematic.
