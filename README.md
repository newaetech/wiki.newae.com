# https://wiki.newae.com Automatic Clone 

This git repo is a simple clone of the NewAE Technology Inc wiki. It uses git-mediawiki to accomplish the clone, and currently is mostly a one-way deal (we haven't tried pushing changes back to Mediawiki yet). Eventually it will accept pull requests, but instead it's suggested to simply register an account on the wiki.

This repo can be used if you need source/text of the wiki pages. It does not include all features of the wiki so does not function as a perfect backup.

We can use the issue tracker to track problems with the wiki as well, rather than pollute the main ChipWhisperer issue tracker.
