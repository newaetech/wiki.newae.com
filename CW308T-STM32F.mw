== Supported Devices ==

todo


== Hardware AES ==

Certain versions of the STM32F have hardware AES. For example the STM32F415RGT6 has hardware AES.

== Programming Connection ==

The 20-pin JTAG port (J6 on CW308 Board) can be used with the [https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/ST-LINK-V2/497-10484-ND/2214535 ST-LINK/V2] which is a low-cost JTAG programmer. Other JTAG programmers (such as OpenOCD) may work.
