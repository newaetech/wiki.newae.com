{{Infobox|This is a BETA target and not yet available. This wiki page will continue to be updated until release. }}

This target is for the ATMega2564RFR2. This makes a great target for exploring IoT technologies, such as mesh networking protocols.

== Programming ==

The ChipWhisperer's AVR programmer supports this target directly. No external programmer is required.

== Schematic ==

See GIT Repo for PDF of schematic.

== Board Layout ==

See GIT Repo for gerber files.

== Radio Usage ==

Note NO ANTENNA is provided as the board is sold only as a sub-assembly and not designed to be used as a radio transmitter. Mounting a 2.4 GHz radio antenna (SMA, NOT reverse-polarity SMA) like Digi-Key P/N 1475-1014-ND could potentially require you to meet FCC/CE guidelines for RF emissions and is UNSUPPORTED USAGE.

== Historical Note ==

The following is the original (-01) schematic. The -01 PCBs were never publicly released and used during development only. The following changes were made in -02:

* MOSI/MISO was switched on Atmel device (requires PCB fix on -01, or PCB will not work)
* TST connected to ground (requires PCB fix on -01, or PCB will not work)
* CLKI pull down
* GPIO3 is now optionally in control of 4066 instead of being hardwired
* Serial resistors added on SCK/MISO/MOSI lines
