== Historical Note ==

The following is the original (-01) schematic. The -01 PCBs were never publicly released and used during development only. The following changes were made in -02:

* MOSI/MISO was switched on Atmel device (requires PCB fix on -01, or PCB will not work)
* TST connected to ground (requires PCB fix on -01, or PCB will not work)
* CLKI pull down
* GPIO3 is now optionally in control of 4066 instead of being hardwired
* Serial resistors added on SCK/MISO/MOSI lines
