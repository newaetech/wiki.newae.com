== Hardware AES ==
The XMEGA device that ships with most standard boards is the ATXmega128D4-AU, the same device on the ChipWhisperer-Lite. This board ''does not'' contain hardware AES to simplify compliance with export rules.

The pin-compatible ATXmega128A4U-AU contains a hardware AES accelerator. If you wish to attack this device, you can purchase the blank CW308T-XMEGA PCB (or download gerbers from the GIT repository and make them yourselves) and mount the appropriate XMEGA device.

== Programming Header ==

The 6-pin programming heading can be used with the Atmel PDI interface. The pinout of the 6-pin programming header on the main-board allows it to work with standard Atmel ISP tools:
