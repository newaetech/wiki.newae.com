The STM32Fx devices have a built-in bootloader, and the ChipWhisperer software as of 3.5.2 includes support for this bootloader.

Important notes before we begin:
* You MUST setup a clock and the serial lines for the chip. This is easily done by selecting a start-up script such as the "AES SimpleSerial on XMEGA" startup script.
* On the STM32F1, you MUST adjust the clock frequency to by 8MHz. The bootloader does not work with our usual 7.37 MHz clock frequency.

To access the bootloader you can perform these steps. They vary based on if you have a "Rev 02" board or a "Rev 03 or Later" board. The revision number is printed on the bottom side as part of the PCB part number (STM32F-03 is Rev -03 for example).

== Rev -02 Boards ==

The Rev -02 boards did not have all programming connections present. They require some additional steps:
