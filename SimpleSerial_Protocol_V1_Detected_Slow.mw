When capturing traces, you may notice a message printed about detection of protocol type:

<syntaxhighlight>
INFO - SimpleSerial: protocol V1.0 detected
INFO - Capture completed.
INFO - SimpleSerial: protocol V1.0 detected
INFO - Capture completed.
INFO - SimpleSerial: protocol V1.0 detected
INFO - Capture completed.
INFO - SimpleSerial: protocol V1.0 detected
INFO - Capture completed.
</syntaxhighlight>

This happens with the basic SimpleSerial protocol. There are two versions of this protocol: V1.0 does not have acknowledgements, and V1.1 does. By default the system will look for an ACK to a basic message, and if no ACK is found falls back to the V1.0 protocol.

If the system detects an ACK in response to the first message, it will use V1.1 protocol. Because you may be hot-swapping target boards, this check is done on each "Capture 1" (but only at the start of a "Capture M", since you wouldn't change targets mid-capture).

There is a slight delay during this version check. You can speed up the response by manually selecting the protocol version:
