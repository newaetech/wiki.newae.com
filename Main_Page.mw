Welcome to ChipWhisperer - the complete open-source toolchain for side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks. This is the main landing page for ChipWhisperer. ChipWhisperer has been presented at conferences such as DEFCON and Blackhat, had a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coflynn/chipwhisperer-lite-a-new-era-of-hardware-security successful Kickstarter (that delivered ahead of schedule)], and placed 2nd place in the first annual Hackaday Prize. ChipWhisperer has been used in a number of academic articles, and is featured in the Car Hacking Handbook. Portions of the design have even been used by [http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-26344 Los Alamos Labs for an electron accelerator]. You can see a full list of references on the [[Press]] page.

ChipWhisperer is maintained by [https://www.newae.com NewAE Technology Inc.], which sells a combination of open-source hardware, supporting tools, training, and consulting services. ChipWhisperer is trademark of NewAE Technology Inc., registered in the US and Europe. This means only NewAE can sell official products under the ChipWhisperer name, and was done to ensure products meet [[Quality Control Guidelines]], as these fairly complex products require good testing to ensure you don't have a frustrating experience.

Beyond supporting just the ChipWhisperer project, this wiki is now growing towards the objective of offering a complete reference on embedded security.

= Getting Started =

Where to begin? If you're new to this area, see the [[Getting Started]] page, which details how you can get involved in side-channel power analysis. From there you can see the hardware documentation (linked below), or take one of the [http://newae.com/training/ Training Courses].

If you're stuck, you can also get help on the [https://www.newae.com/forum Discussion Forum].

= Software Documentation =

ChipWhisperer is an open-source project. All of the source code is available from the [https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer Git Repository]. For more information about the software releases, see [https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/releases Releases] or the installation instructions at [[Installing ChipWhisperer]].

The following pages document some of the many features of the ChipWhisperer Capture and Analyzer software, along with some other ChipWhisperer interfaces:

* [[Installing ChipWhisperer]]
* [[Common Tool Information]]
** [[Making Scripts]]
** [[Adding Modules/Parameters]]
* [[CW-Capture Tool]]
** [[Glitch Explorer]]
** [[Serial Terminal]]
* [[CW-Analyzer Tool]]
* [[File Formats]]
* [[MATLAB Control of CW-Lite]]

The remaining documentation is intended for developers:

* [[Error Messages / Common Problems]]
* [[FPGA Details]]
* [[CW Release Steps]]

= Sample Projects and Tutorials =

== ChipWhisperer Tutorials ==

The following tutorials use the ChipWhisperer software and/or hardware. They are designed to take you through a complete attack. You may also want to check the page on [[Embedded Attacks]] for more snippets of simple attacks and other things you should verify when making a secure system.

Not all tutorials are possible with all hardware. See the various tutorial pages for details.

{{Template:Tutorials}}

== Example Attacks / Other ==

While ChipWhisperer started as a side-channel power analysis platform, it has grown to be useful in other attack types. This section is designed to show you a wide variety of attacks on embedded systems, to give you an idea of what is required for building secure embedded systems. These are held on the page [[Embedded Attacks]].

In 2016, ChipWhisperer was used as part of the CHES2016 CTF challenge. See details of the event on the [[CHES2016 CTF]] page.
