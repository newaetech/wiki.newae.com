<strong> ChipWhispererÂ® by NewAE Technology Inc. </strong>

Welcome to ChipWhisperer - the complete open-source toolchain for side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks. This is the main landing page for ChipWhisperer as of April 2016, with the objective of transitioning most community material into this format. ChipWhisperer has been presented at conferences such as DEFCON and Blackhat, had a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coflynn/chipwhisperer-lite-a-new-era-of-hardware-security successful Kickstarter (that delivered ahead of schedule)], and placed 2nd place in the first annual Hackaday Prize. ChipWhisperer has been used in a number of academic articles, and is featured in the Car Hacking Handbook. Portions of the design have even been used by [http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-26344 Los Alamos Labs for an electron accelerator]. You can see a full list of references on the [[Press]] page.

ChipWhisperer is maintained by [https://www.newae.com NewAE Technology Inc.], which sells a combination of open-source hardware, supporting tools, training, and consulting services. ChipWhisperer is trademark of NewAE Technology Inc., registered in the US and Europe. This means only NewAE can sell official products under the ChipWhisperer name, and was done to ensure products meet [[Quality Control Guidelines]], as these fairly complex products require good testing to ensure you don't have a frustrating experience.

== Recent/Upcoming Events ==

The following events will be either be attended by someone from NewAE, or have a presentation using the ChipWhisperer.

* Blackhat USA 2016 (Training based on ChipWhisperer + 2x talks by Colin)
* CHES 2016 (Sponsor, will have exhibit booth)

== Getting Started ==

Where to begin? If you're new to this area, see the [[Getting Started]] page, which details how you can get involved in side-channel power analysis. From there you can see the hardware documentation (linked below), or take one of the [http://newae.com/training/ Training Courses].

Source code is held in the [https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/git/source Git Repository].

You can get help on the [https://www.newae.com/forum Discussion Forum].

= Example Attacks / Other =

While ChipWhisperer started as a side-channel power analysis platform, it has grown to be useful in other attack types. This section is designed to show you a wide variety of attacks on embedded systems, to give you an idea of what is required for building secure embedded systems.

These are held on the page [[Embedded Attacks]].

= Capture The Flag =

In 2016 ChipWhisperer is used as part of the [[CHES2016 CTF]]. See details of the event on the [[CHES2016 CTF]] page.

= Extra Notes =

See the page [[Thanks]] for a note about the people who made this project possible.
