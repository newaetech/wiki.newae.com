<strong> ChipWhispererÂ® by NewAE Technology Inc. </strong>

Welcome to ChipWhisperer - the complete open-source toolchain for side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks. This is the main landing page for ChipWhisperer as of January 2017, with the objective of transitioning most community material into this format. ChipWhisperer has been presented at conferences such as DEFCON and Blackhat, had a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coflynn/chipwhisperer-lite-a-new-era-of-hardware-security successful Kickstarter (that delivered ahead of schedule)], and placed 2nd place in the first annual Hackaday Prize. ChipWhisperer has been used in a number of academic articles, and is featured in the Car Hacking Handbook. Portions of the design have even been used by [http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-26344 Los Alamos Labs for an electron accelerator]. You can see a full list of references on the [[Press]] page.

ChipWhisperer is maintained by [https://www.newae.com NewAE Technology Inc.], which sells a combination of open-source hardware, supporting tools, training, and consulting services. ChipWhisperer is trademark of NewAE Technology Inc., registered in the US and Europe. This means only NewAE can sell official products under the ChipWhisperer name, and was done to ensure products meet [[Quality Control Guidelines]], as these fairly complex products require good testing to ensure you don't have a frustrating experience.

= Getting Started =

Where to begin? If you're new to this area, see the [[Getting Started]] page, which details how you can get involved in side-channel power analysis. From there you can see the hardware documentation (linked below), or take one of the [http://newae.com/training/ Training Courses].

If you're stuck, you can also get help on the [https://www.newae.com/forum Discussion Forum].

= Hardware Documentation =

{{Template:Hardware}}

= Software Documentation =

ChipWhisperer is an open-source project. All of the source code is available from the [https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/git/source Git Repository]. For more information about the software releases, see [https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/wiki/ChipWhisperer_Software_Firmware_Releases Releases].

The following pages document some of the many features of the ChipWhisperer Capture and Analyzer software:

* [[Installing ChipWhisperer]]
* [[Common Tool Information]]
** [[Making Scripts]]
** [[Adding Modules/Parameters]]
* [[CW-Capture Tool]]
** [[Glitch Explorer]]
** [[Serial Terminal]]
* [[CW-Analyzer Tool]]
* [[File Formats]]

The remaining documentation is intended for developers:

* [[Error Messages / Common Problems]]
* [[FPGA Details]]
* [[CW Release Steps]]

= Sample Projects and Tutorials =

== Theory ==

* [[Correlation Power Analysis]]
* [[Template Attacks]]
* [[Extending AES-128 Attacks to AES-256]]

== ChipWhisperer Tutorials ==

The following tutorials use the ChipWhisperer software and/or hardware. They are designed to take you through a complete attack. You may also want to check the page on [[Embedded Attacks]] for more snippets of simple attacks and other things you should verify when making a secure system.

Not all tutorials are possible with all hardware. See the various tutorial pages for details.

{{Template:Tutorials}}

== ChipWhisperer Half-Baked Tutorials ==

The following aren't complete tutorials as the above, but instead show you a little bit about what you can accomplish with this system. They may eventually turn into complete tutorials, but for now are designed to provide some inspiration and reference.

* [[Attacking TEA with CPA]]
* [[Investigating Block Cipher Modes with DPA]]
* [[Profiling Attacks with Neural Networks]]
* [[AES-CCM Attack]]
* [[MATLAB Control of CW-Lite]]

== Hardware-Specific Examples/Tutorials ==

* [[CW308T-AVR / CW308T-XMEGA: Stand-Alone Simple Serial Example ]]

== Example Attacks / Other ==

While ChipWhisperer started as a side-channel power analysis platform, it has grown to be useful in other attack types. This section is designed to show you a wide variety of attacks on embedded systems, to give you an idea of what is required for building secure embedded systems. These are held on the page [[Embedded Attacks]].

In 2016 ChipWhisperer is used as part of the CHES2016 CTF challenge. See details of the event on the [[CHES2016 CTF]] page.

= Recent/Upcoming Events =

The following events will be either be attended by someone from NewAE, or have a presentation using the ChipWhisperer.

* Blackhat USA 2016 (Training based on ChipWhisperer + 2x talks by Colin + Arsenal)
* CHES 2016 (Sponsor, will have exhibit booth)


= Extra Notes =
