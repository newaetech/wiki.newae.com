<strong> ChipWhisperer® by NewAE Technology Inc. </strong>

Welcome to ChipWhisperer - the world's first (and so far only) complete open-source toolchain for side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks. This is the main landing page for ChipWhisperer as of April 2016, with the objective of transitioning most community material into this format. ChipWhisperer has been presented at conferences such as DEFCON and Blackhat, had a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coflynn/chipwhisperer-lite-a-new-era-of-hardware-security successful Kickstarter (that delivered ahead of schedule)], and placed 2nd place in the first annual Hackaday Prize. ChipWhisperer has been used in a number of academic articles, and is featured in the Car Hacking Handbook. Portions of the design have even been used by [http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-26344 Los Alamos Labs for an electron accelerator]. You can see a full list of references on the [[Press]] page.

ChipWhisperer is maintained by [https://www.newae.com NewAE Technology Inc.], which sells a combination of open-source hardware, supporting tools, training, and consulting services. ChipWhisperer is trademark of NewAE Technology Inc., registered in the US and Europe. This means only NewAE can sell official products under the ChipWhisperer name, and was done to ensure products meet [[Quality Control Guidelines]], as these fairly complex products require good testing to ensure you don't have a frustrating experience.

== Recent/Upcoming Events ==

The following events will be either be attended by someone from NewAE, or have a presentation using the ChipWhisperer.
