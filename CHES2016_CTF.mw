[chesworkshop.org|CHES 2016] will have a brand new Capture The Flag (CTF) event, run by Colin O'Flynn. This event will challenge novice and advanced embedded security researchers alike, by providing a platform to exchange AES implementations with various countermeasures (including against power analysis, and against firmware analysis using white box crypto).

== Attack Website ==

There are two types of cryptographic implementations available for your browsing pleasure. They are either:

1. AES-128 running on Atmel XMEGA, with power analysis. Key not stored in firmware (attack via DPA).
2. AES-128 running on Linux computer, without power analysis. Key stored in firmware (White box).

As a user, you can submit source-code to accomplish #1, which will run the code on an embedded hardware platform.
