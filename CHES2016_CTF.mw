[http://chesworkshop.org/ches2016/start.php CHES 2016] will have a brand new Capture The Flag (CTF) event, run by [http://www.oflynn.com Colin O'Flynn], with resources by [https://www.newae.com NewAE Technology Inc]. This event will challenge novice and advanced embedded security researchers alike, by providing a platform to exchange AES implementations with various countermeasures (including against power analysis, and against firmware analysis using white box crypto).

Access the website at http://ctf.newae.com .

== Attack Website ==

There are two types of cryptographic implementations available for your browsing pleasure. They are either:

1. AES-128 running on Atmel XMEGA, with power analysis. Key not stored in firmware (attack via DPA).

2. AES-128 running on Linux computer, without power analysis. Key stored in firmware (White box).

As a user, you can submit source-code to accomplish #1, which will run the code on an embedded hardware platform.
