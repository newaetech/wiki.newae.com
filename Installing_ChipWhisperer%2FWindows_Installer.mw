Starting with ChipWhisperer v3.5.1 there is a 32-bit and 64-bit Windows installer. This installer packages together:

* ChipWhisperer directory (same as in GIT).
* Python binary & required libraries.
* Windows USB drivers.
* GIT too for updates.

This will install ChipWhisperer to a location on your hard drive. Note it must be somewhere you can edit, as you may need to change or rebuild firmware files as part of the tutorials.
