= Background Information =
- Difficulties with voltage glitching 
  - FPGAs do everything at the same time
  - SRAM holds configuration
- Crowbar circuit

= Setup =
== Hardware Setup ==
- SMA cable 
- Picture

== Software Setup ==
- Script
- Bitstream (same as Tutorial 1)
- Glitch module setup
  - Glitch only
  - HS-Glitch
- Same idea as Tutorial 3

= Hints =
- Might be easier on the edge of working conditions
- Changing core voltage level
- Changing clock speed
  - CLKGEN output
  - CW305 PLL
  - Max speed depends on FPGA implementation
- Enable-only output
  - Only use repeat and offset
  - EXTCLK for speed-up
