The CW1173 contains two 8-pin connectors, which use our standard 8-pin Smart-Card header pinout. One header connects to the SAM3U device (which has ISO-7816 drivers), one header connects to the FPGA. Note there is currently no firmware support for these devices, but the hardware is designed for any of the following:

* Emulating a smart card (use interposer board), or fuzzing a smart card reader
* Communicating to a smart card
* Sniffing traffic between a legitimate reader and smart card
* Side-channel analysis of smart card device

Header J7 (Connects to SAM3U):
