==categorytree==

Issues:

1) The categorytree isn't rebuilt. Make a new category & add to [[Category:TocRoot]] for example, it wont' appear until you come back & save this page. Or add a page to that category and still no love until you resave this page. Is there a way to rebuild ALL of them across the wiki (for example I use a few on https://wiki.newae.com/Category:Knowledge_base)? I'd rather not just disable the cache sitewide.

2) Weird circular dependencies. See the 'Knowledge Base' - I think this comes about because [[Category:Tutorials]] links to both the TocCategory & the Examples category?

<categorytree mode=all depth=4 hideroot='on' style="float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1ex; border:1px solid gray; padding:0.7ex; background-color:white;">TocRoot</categorytree>
