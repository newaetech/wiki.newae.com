==categorytree==

Issues:

1. The categorytree isn't rebuilt. Make a new category & add to [[:Category:TocRoot]] for example, it wont' appear until you come back & save this page. Or add a page to that category and still no love until you resave this page. Is there a way to rebuild ALL of them across the wiki (for example I use a few categorytrees on https://wiki.newae.com/Category:Knowledge_base that I also have to remember to 'force update')? I guess just forcing rebuild of specific pages even & I have a list of those pages?

2. Weird circular dependencies. See the 'Knowledge Base' entry on the categorytree below contains 'Knowledge Base' as a subcategory - I think this comes about because [[:Category:Tutorials]] links to both the TocRoot & the Examples category? I want this link for other reasons (the tutorials are a type of Example, but I also want them at a separate location in the categorytree).

What might be nice here is some way to tell it NOT to include some type of category in the categorytree. For example the 'Knowledge Base' entry shouldn't have the 'Tutorials' below it, because that category is already listed elsewhere '''directly under''' the TocRoot. This might be the desired logic: if a subcategory is '''already a direct child of the root''' of the categorytree, '''DON'T''' include it as a subcategory within the tree. There is already a 'higher-level' link elsewhere.

Presumably this would just be an option in LocalSettings to turn such logic on/off.
