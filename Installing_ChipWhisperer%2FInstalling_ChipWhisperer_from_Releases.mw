Once you have a working Python installation, you're ready to install and run ChipWhisperer. 

First, download a ChipWhisperer release. You can get these from the [https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/releases/ Releases] page. Generally, the latest release is a good choice, but you might need an older version for various reasons. You want the source code in .zip or .tar.gz format - not a VMWare image.

Next, uncompress your downloaded source code somewhere. Generally, 'somewhere' will become your ChipWhisperer working directory. For example, on Windows, you might want to use <code>C:\chipwhisperer\</code>. 

Once you've got the file, run the Python install procedure (setup.py). Use the ''develop'' command to indicate that the files will probably be changing frequently. to do this, open a terminal and run the following, adjusting paths as needed:

<pre>
cd c:\chipwhisperer\software
python setup.py develop</pre>

'''NB''': This assumes the python command links to Python-2.7, and not Python-3.x. You may need to specify either python2.7 or python27 as the command instead of python to force this.

''In Linux, you might need to run this as root:''
<code>sudo python setup.py develop</code>

The installation is now finished. To confirm the installation worked, you can run ChipWhispererAnalyzer in the same terminal:

<pre>cd c:\chipwhisperer\software\chipwhisperer\
python CWAnalyzer.pyw</pre>

Alternatively you can just double-click on <code>CWAnalyzer.py</code>, which should run the file using Python, ''provided you've registered Python to execute the .py extension''.
