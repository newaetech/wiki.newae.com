The ChipWhisperer-Lite Bare Board consists of two main parts: a multi-purpose power analysis capture instrument, and a target board. The target board is a standard microcontroller which you can implement algorithms onto. For example if you wish to evaluate an AES library, you can program that library into the target board and perform the power analysis.

== Connection Quick-Start ==
<ol>
<li>Follow the [[Installing ChipWhisperer]] instructions for the ChipWhisperer software and its prerequisites.</li>
<li>Connect ChipWhisperer-Lite, install USB Drivers:
<dl>
<dt>Windows:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Plug micro-USB cable into ChipWhisperer-Lite</li>
<li>If the &quot;New Hardware Found&quot; wizard doesn't prompt you for drivers, go to the control panel and find the &quot;ChipWhisperer-Lite&quot; device, and select "Update Drivers".</li>
<li>You can find drivers in <code>c:\chipwhisperer\hardware\capture\chipwhisperer-lite\</code>. You will likely need to extract them from the <code>cwlite_usb_driver.zip</code> file. If so simply extract them somewhere (i.e. your desktop), and then point the new hardware found wizard to that location.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>Linux:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Driver installation is not required, but if you do not update the 'udev' system, you will be unable to run ChipWhisperer-Capture as a regular user. To update the udev system, first make sure the ChipWhisperer-Lite is Make a file called <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-cwlite.rules</code> . The contents of this file should be:</p>
<pre># allow users to claim the device
SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;2b3e&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;ace2&quot;, MODE=&quot;0664&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;</pre></li>
<li><p>Add your username to the plugdev group:</p>
<pre>$ sudo usermod -a -G plugdev YOUR-USERNAME</pre></li>
<li><p>And reset the udev system:</p>
<pre>$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules</pre></li>
<li>Finally log out &amp; in again for the group change to take effect.</li>
<li>Connect the micro-USB cable</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>MAC:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>No special installation required - must ensure you have installed libusb via homebrew (see instructions at [[MacOSX_Installation]]).</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</li>
<li><p>To check for a successful installation Run ChipWhisperer-Capture. This can be done from one of three ways:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Double-click on <code>CWCapture.pyw</code> in the <code>chipwhisperer\software</code> folder. You must have installed Python into your path for this to work.</li>
<li>run <code>python CWCapture.pyw</code> from the <code>chipwhisperer\software</code> folder using a command prompt with Python in the path.</li>
<li>run <code>python CWCaptureGUI.py</code> from the <code>chipwhisperer\software\chipwhisperer\capture\ui</code> directory.</li></ul>

<p>The last option is the most reliable, in that it should always work on all platforms. If it doesn't start look for possible missing modules or other useful errors.</p>
<blockquote><p>'''hint'''</p>
<p>The first time you run ChipWhisperer-Capture or -Analyzer, the default setup of the screen is somewhat insane. You can drag windows around or close them to make it look more like the demos here. See the Video quickstart guide as well for details of that.</p></blockquote></blockquote></li>
<li><p>From the &quot;Scripts&quot; directory, run the <code>ChipWhisperer-Lite: AES SimpleSerial on XMEGA</code> script:</p>
<p>[[File:cwlite_simpleserial.png|image]]</p>
<p>This should connect to the ChipWhisperer-Lite, program the FPGA, and run a few captures. Your screen should look something like this now:</p>
<p>[[File:Step Connection Quick Start 05 02.PNG|1000px|image]]</p></li>
<li><p>If the previous step fails, you may need to set the path for the &quot;firmware&quot;. This is done by going to the &quot;Tools&quot; menu and selecting the &quot;Config CW Firmware&quot; option. Note on MAC OS X a special command is required instead sometimes, see [[MacOSX_Installation]].</p>
<p>From there, hit the &quot;FIND&quot; button beside the &quot;FPGA .zip (Release)&quot; option. Point it to the file located at <code>chipwhisperer/hardware/capture/chipwhisperer-lite/cwlite_firmware.zip</code> on your filesystem.</p></li>
<li>Your ChipWhisperer-Lite is now connected. See the next section for details of the demo attack.</li></ol>

== Capture and Attack Quickstart ==

# See [[Tutorial_B5_Breaking_AES_(Straightforward)]]for details. Note the hardware setup is slightly different -- but you can skip to step 5.5.3, and should be able to pick up from there. Be sure to use the <code>ChipWhisperer-Lite: AES SimpleSerial on XMEGA</code> script instead of the one referenced in step 5.5.3.

== Important Bugs/Caveats ==

The following includes various things that might trip you up:

# If you save the project ''before'' running the capture, you can specify any directory. Traces will be copied to the appropriate location during capture.
# If you save the project ''after'' running the capture, you must save the project to the same directory that &quot;default-data-dir&quot; exists in. This is normally the folder from where you invoked the Python GUI.
# There are a few warnings/exceptions that come up (i.e. divide-by-zero). Generally just keep going and see if things are still working. A number of those are on the ''TODO'' list to fix but I didn't get around to it yet.
# The &quot;Total Ops&quot; window which checks for proper AES operation requires PyCrypto to be installed.
# By default the XMEGA device was programmed with a partial AES implementation only. This is done to avoid any crypto export issues. This does not affect your side-channel analysis, but be aware the returned value might not appear to be correct (since only the first couple rounds of AES occurred).

= Advanced Usage =

== Mounting Jumpers ==

Note the ChipWhisperer-Lite main board and target section contain a number of jumper options. By default these are not mounted, and solder jumper bridges on the PCB have been bridged to select the appropriate options when required. Some options are only solder jumpers, which to move the jumper requires a soldering iron to bridge or clear the appropriate connections.

The following lists jumpers on the ChipWhisperer-Lite / Target Section:

; Capture Section Jumpers
* JP4 is the "RESET" net for the SAM3U processor.
* JP2 causes the SAM3U processor flash memory to be erased. When the chip is erased a rom-resident bootloader takes over. See section XXXXX for bootloader details.
* JP5 selects the IO voltage for the FPGA bank which connects to the 20-pin target. By default SJ6 selects this to be 3.3V. It is not recommended to change this, as it is easy to damage the FPGA by feeding an out-of-range voltage in.
* SJ1 selects if the power supply comes from the Micro-USB connector (default) or an external 5V supply at the +5VIN pin.
; Target Section Jumpers:
* JP7 connects the "MEASURE" SMA to the XMEGA VCC Rail. Shorted by default with SJ4.
* JP6 connects the "GLITCH" SMA to the XMEGA VCC Rail. Shorted by default with SJ5.
* JP12 can be used to feed an external voltage into the XMEGA VCC Rail. By default SJ3 connects this to 3.3V.
* SJ2 selects if the 3.3V rail comes from the 20-pin IDC connector (i.e. ChipWhisperer-Lite board), or via an optional LDO and USB connector.
