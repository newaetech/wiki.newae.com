== Example Project ==

== Known Issues ==

Note the -02 Revision of the PCB has swapped the markings of the CLKIN/CLKOUT. The correct pinout is:

* CLKIN connects to P84
* CLKOUT connects to P85

The CLKIN pin is a _N clock pin. If you need the _P clock pin, you can use a jumper on the CW308 board to route the clock input into the CLKOUT pin.

== Programming ==

The ChipWhisperer will eventually support programming this target. Until then, you will need an external programmer. This is connected via JTAG to the pin headers:

Options for programmers include:

* Xilinx Platform Cable USB or USB-II (Digikey/Mouser).
* Clone JTAG programmers off AliExpress/E-Bay for low cost (search 'Xilinx JTAG').
* Digilent Inc HS1/HS2/HS3 Cables (NB: you may need separate jumper wires).

== Schematic ==

See GIT Repo for PDF of schematic.
