== Preprocessing Modules ==
Are filters that modify the traces from a given trace source (that can be another Preprocessing Module or the Trace Manager) and works as a new trace source to the next module in the chain (called trace observer).

=== Sum of Difference ===

This module, also known as Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD), is used to re-synchronize traces as in the case of signals with time jitter. See [[Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) Pre-Processing]]
