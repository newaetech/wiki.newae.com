If you want the cutting-edge version of ChipWhisperer, you can clone the repository. If you have Git already set up, this is easy to do:
<code>
git clone git@github.com:newaetech/chipwhisperer.git
cd chipwhisperer/software
python setup.py develop
</code>

You may also want the OpenADC software, which is necessary to build new firmware for the ChipWhisperer FPGA. This is unnecessary for most users. If you need it:
<code>
cd ..
git clone git://git.assembla.com/openadc.git
cd openadc/controlsw/python
python setup.py develop
</code>
