This board contains details of hardware for experimenting with two types of IEEE 802.15.4 SoC Devices: Atmel ATMega128RFA1, and TI CC2530. Appropriate clocks are provided, along with shunts in VCCINT power rails.

Connectors for 2.4 GHz antennas are provided - be aware the RF matching is very poor (to reduce BOM I use same Balun for both, even though they do NOT have some impedance match requirements). In practice if you are sending data directly the match is 'close enough'.

The clock routing doesn't contain a jumper to allow introduction of external clock for clock glitching.
