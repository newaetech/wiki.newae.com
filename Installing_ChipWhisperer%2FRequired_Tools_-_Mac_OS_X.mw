<h2> Python </h2>
The following have been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) - earlier versions may not have a recent enough Python installation (recommended 2.7.6 or later). It's possible to install other Python versions on your Mac OS X via the 'homebrew' system, we will use this for installing a few additional required tools.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Ensure your user account has a password. In order for the 'sudo' command to work it requires you to type your password, so if you don't have one enabled be sure to set a temporary password now.</li>
<li><p>Install the 'homebrew' system, see [http://brew.sh brew.sh] for details. Briefly, you can install it by pasting the following in a terminal:</p>
<pre>$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</pre></li>
<li><p>As PySide is based on Qt 4, which is not officially supported by Homebrew, you will need to load the [https://github.com/cartr/homebrew-qt4 homebrew-qt4 tap]:</p>
<pre>$ brew tap cartr/qt4</pre></li>
<li><p>Install PySide using homebrew:</p>
<pre>$ brew install pyside</pre>
<p>The install will probably print a message like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[[File:Install_macosx_brewpath.png|image]]</p></blockquote>
<p>Note you must run that command in order to successfully import the modules, in this example it would be:</p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p /Users/macmini/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
$ echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/macmini/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth</pre></li></ol>

<h2> SciPy </h2>
You may need to upgrade your SciPy from the base install if you wish to do template attacks. This is not needed for other attacks, so please only proceed with the following if you receive an error that your version of scipy is too old.

The easiest method is to use brew again:

 brew install scipy

You will also need to follow the instructions as above (inserting the link to the brew site-packages location). You will finally need to run the following:

 brew link --overwrite numpy

<h2> AVR-GCC </h2>

You can easily use brew to install avr-gcc, as decribed at [https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr/ OSX-Cross Project]:

 $ brew tap osx-cross/avr
 
 $ brew install avr-libc
