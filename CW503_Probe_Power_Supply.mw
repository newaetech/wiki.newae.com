The CW503 provides a handy power supply for both the differential probe and the LNA. Multiple probes can be connected to a single power supply. The following shows the internal block diagram of the CW503 probe power supply:

The use of isolated DC-DC converters allows you to use connected probes without worry about ground loops. Note the probe is ''not designed'' for use at high isolation voltages (&gt;30V).

The power supply uses a micro-USB jack, allowing you to power the probe from front-pane USB ports on some instruments (be careful of current limits if using this method):

Alternatively the probe comes with a high-quality 5.0V wall-wart adapter, which has been selected for minimum noise input to the CW503.

== Front-Panel Connections ==

The following can be found on the front panel of the device:

<ul>
<li><p>Power Good LEDs:</p>
<blockquote><p>The probe PSU monitors the +7.8V, -7.8V, and +3.3V outputs. If these outputs fall below the required setpoints the LEDs extinguish. This is normally due to excessive current draw or a short on one of the output lines.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>6-Pin Probe PSU Connectors:</p>
<blockquote><p>This probe supply connectors use the same pinout as our Low Noise Amplifier (CW502) and Differential Probe (CW501). The pinout is as follows:</p>
{|
! Pin
! Name
|-
| 1
| +7.8V Out
|-
| 2
| GND
|-
| 3
| Aux Out
|-
| 4
| +3.3V Out
|-
| 5
| -7.8V Out
|-
| 6
| GND
|}
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>PROBE-GND Pin Header:</p>
<blockquote><p>This pin header connects to the GND pins on the 6-pin connector.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>AUX-IN Pin Header:</p>
<blockquote><p>This pin header connects to the &quot;Aux Out&quot; pin on the 6-pin connector.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>USB-GND Pin Header:</p>
<blockquote><p>This pin header connects to the USB negative (ground). You can connect this to the PROBE-GND to remove the isolation, or use a resistor if you want to reduce voltage differential without directly connecting them.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
