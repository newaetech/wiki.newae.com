This is a basic prototype board which can be used for mounting other chips on the [[CW308 UFO Target]]. It can also be used to mount small boards (see the examples for photos).

== Usage ==


== Examples ==

The following shows several examples of this board in use.

=== Hue Bridge 2.0 ===

This shows an extreme example of mounting a board onto the victim board. The actual analysis was being done on the SAMR21R on the main board, but this provided mechanical stability to allow tacking wires onto that area.

=== Hue ATMega2564RF2R Based Bulb ===

The SPI traffic was wired out as well in this example, and a ChipWhisperer-Pro was used to trigger on SPI traffic.

=== Riscure CTF Board ===

This example allowed both power analysis and clock glitching to be performed against the board. A small shunt resistor is soldered in-line for the VCC pin.
