This tutorial is a continuation from [[Tutorial CW305-1 Building a Project]]. Here, we'll use our hardware setup to find a fixed secret key that the Artix FPGA is using for AES encryption. This tutorial relies on previous knowledge from [[Tutorial B5 Breaking AES (Straightforward)]], so make sure you know how that attack works.

= Theoretical Background =
- Hardware AES
- Operations done in single clock cycle
- Spectrum of speed vs size
- Difficulty of finding leakage (HW vs HD)

= Capture Setup =
- Reference last tutorial
- Mention what the default settings are
- Look at one trace (especially for the length)
- Explain that there's little leakage
- Set up for 5000 traces
- Capture many

= Analysis =
- Load project
- Most default settings are fine
- Change leakage to HD
- Results
