This tutorial is a more hands-on version of the [[Tutorial B7 Profiling Attacks (with HW Assumption)|previous tutorial]]. Rather than getting the ChipWhisperer Analyzer software to generate the points of interest and the template distributions, this tutorial will work directly with the recorded trace data in Python. 

It is '''highly recommended''' that you read the theory page on [[Template Attacks]] before attempting this tutorial. There is some relatively complex processing involved, and it may be helpful to get a mathematical view on the steps before attempting to program them.

Additionally, this tutorial uses some terminology from previous tutorials, such as ''Hamming weight'' and ''substitution box''. If you don't know what these are, [[Tutorial B6 Breaking AES (Manual CPA Attack)]] might be an easier starting point.

= Gotchas =
* Too little data (0 or 1 trace)
* Flukes + statistics
