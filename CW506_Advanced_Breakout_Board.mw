The CW506 is a simple but powerful breakout board for devices using NewAE Technology's [[20-Pin Connector]] standard. Almost all of our target boards and capture hardware feature this connector, making the breakout board widely applicable to our product line.

The breakout board features a variety of voltage translators, test points, connectors, and switches that makes it simple to interface various test equipment and target devices together. This includes both connecting other lab equipment, along with connecting ChipWhisperer capture hardware to your own targets.
