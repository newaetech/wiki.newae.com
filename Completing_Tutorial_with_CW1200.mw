<h2> Setting up the Hardware </h2>

This tutorial uses the [[CW1200_ChipWhisperer-Pro]] hardware. 

# Remove the ChipWhisperer-Pro main capture hardware, UFO Board, and SMA cable from the ChipWhisperer-Pro case.
# Attached the UFO board to the ChipWhisperer-Pro with the 20-pin cable, and connect the '''VOUT''' SMA connector to the '''MEASURE''' input.
# Power up the ChipWhisperer-Pro with the 5V DC power adapter, and connect the USB cable to the computer.
# If this the first time powering up, you will need to install the drivers (see [[CW1200_ChipWhisperer-Pro]]).
