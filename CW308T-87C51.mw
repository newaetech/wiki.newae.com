The 87C51 target is designed for a line of 8051 processors made by Intel in PLCC44 package, although other manufactures make equivalent devices as well (notably NXP as well).

= Project Build Notes =

Example projects can be built with MCU 8051 IDE - it's free for Linux platforms, and for Windows is approx 10EUR. See [http://www.moravia-microsystems.com/ MCU 8051 IDE] to download. This includes a simulator with virtual hardware, which is very useful for initial analysis.

This also requires installing SDCC for the C compilation, see the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc Sourceforge Page] to download.

You can also simply run the Makefiles to build the project.

= Example Project =

The default device is programmed with a simple test program. This allows testing of side-channel power analysis and clock glitching. 

= Hardware Specifics =

== Programming Microcontroller ==

The target board contains an ATMega8515, which can be used for performing program verification. It is also used to generate trigger points for attacks such as encryption table read-out & inserting glitches into the program read logic. The programming interface contains the following limitations:

* No programming is possible as there is no VPP generation.
* Address lines A0 - A11 only are mapped to the ATMega8515 (up to 4096 bytes). The upper two lines are mapped to the LEDs with pull-downs, but with additional jumpers can be set for dumping the full address space (see jumpers section).

== Target Microcontroller ==

The default target device is an Intel EE87C51RB1 (16K EPROM, 512 RAM). Useful references:

* [http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/8XC54_51FX_51RX.pdf NXP 8XC51RA+/RB+ Datasheet]

NOTE: The Intel datasheet is fairly short (20 pages) and does not include full details of the programming. This can be found in the NXP datasheet.

== Jumpers ==

A number of jumpers are present on the target board. They are mostly used to select different features and options. A brief description of them is below:

* J1: Selects if the ATMega8515 is enabled or not. When not enabled (J1 in "RUN" mode), the ATMega8515 shuts down.
* J2: Selects the EA pin connection. When running a program must be set to "RUN" mode to run program memory from internal EPROM.
* J3 & J4: Select if the serial port connects to the 8051 chip (at P3.0/P3.1) or to the ATMega8515.
* J5: Select if GPIO4 (normally trigger-in to CW-Lite) goes to the 8051 chip (at P1.0) or the ATMega8515. When connected to the 8051 this allows usage of trigger from code in the 8051. When connected to the ATMega8515 allows a trigger to come from programming logic.
* J6: Select if GPIO3 connects to the 8051 reset pin or to the 
* J7: If using the ATMega8515, selects the "mode". This is used to enable optional logic, and should normally be in "NORM" mode.

The "Target-Defined Header" at J15 is used to set pins P3.3/P3.4/P3.5 to high/low. These pins each contain pull-downs, and mounting a header will set the associated pin high as shown below:
{| class="wikitable"
!Shunt Location
!8051 Pin
|-
|H1 - H2
|P3.3 = 1 when jumper mounted, 0 when jumper not mounted.
|-
|H3 - H4
|P3.4 = 1 when jumper mounted, 0 when jumper not mounted.
|-
|H5 - H6
|P3.5 = 1 when jumper mounted, 0 when jumper not mounted.
|}
These pins are used to specify the operating mode of the main test processor.

If using the program/verification mode, the following additional settings allow indexing of the full 16K-bytes of the 87C51RB device:

* Jumper from LED2 to LED3.
* Jumper from LED1 to Pin 1 of J6 (the left-most pin).
