Interested in side channel analysis? This page should help you get some ideas of where to start.

= Hardware =
ChipWhisperer is maintained by NewAE Technology Inc. The ChipWhisperer boards take away the frustration of setting up the hardware for side channel attacks.. You can get your hands on one of the boards at [https://store.newae.com/ The NewAE Store]. As of June 2016, The ChipWhisperer Lite (CW1173) is a great way to get started: it comes with a "victim" already connected, so you can start the tutorials out-of-the-box.

= Software =
ChipWhisperer's software is open-source and freely available online.
* If you want a nice, tidy download, check out the [https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/chipwhisperer/ChipWhisperer_Software_Firmware_Releases ChipWhisperer Releases]. The information on this page will explain how to download and install the software.
* If you're familiar with Git, you can directly clone the [https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/git/source ChipWhisperer Repository]. This will get you a bleeding-edge copy of the software, which has the most recent bug fixes and the most recent bugs.

= Tutorials =
The tutorials on this wiki provide an introduction to ChipWhisperer. The main focus in these tutorials is breaking AES-128; if this is your main goal, start with these three tutorials:
* [[Tutorial B1 Building a SimpleSerial Project]] to get used to the ChipWhisperer framework
* [[Tutorial B2 Viewing Instruction Power Differences]] to experiment with capturing traces
* [[Tutorial B5 Breaking AES (Straightforward)]] to break AES!
