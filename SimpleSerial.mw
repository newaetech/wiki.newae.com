Y = YES, Command support for application.

N = NO, Command not supported for application.

M = MAYBE, Command may be supported depending on build target.

== Encryption Application ==
The encryption application provides a simple method to encrypt a plaintext into a ciphertext. This application was the original "simple serial". The following operations are performed:
# Load encryption key with 'k' command (for example, k2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c\n sets key to k2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c).
# Set input text to encryption module with 'p' command. Device encrypts input text, and toggles the I/O trigger line during the encryption operation.
# The ciphertext is returned with the 'r' command.

== Authentication Application ==
The authentication application does not expose the result of the encryption. Instead, the result is used only in authentication mode, where the following operations are performed:
# Load encryption key with 'k' command (for example, k2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c\n sets key to k2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c).
# Set the authentication challenge with 't' command.
# Set input text to encryption module with 'p' command. Device encrypts input text, and toggles the I/O trigger line during the encryption operation.
# Device compares the resulting ciphertext with the challenge set with 't'.
# If challenge and ciphertext match (auth OK), device responds with 'r1000000000000000\n'. If do not match, device response with 'r0000000000000000\n'.
The authentication application is the '''default shipped with ALL programmed modules'''.
