The CW1200 (ChipWhisperer Pro) is an upgraded version of the ChipWhisperer Lite capture hardware. The Pro includes an FPGA with much more space than the Lite, allowing many new features to be added, including a larger sample buffer, streaming-mode captures, additional trigger methods, and a touchscreen interface. These features make it a high-end device suitable for laboratory use.

Check out a [https://youtu.be/qS6JwX4SBOI sneak peek of the CW-Pro].

'''(TODO: picture of CW-Pro)'''

= Power Supply =
The ChipWhisperer Pro can only be powered through its 5 V jack. It cannot be powered through the USB port - internally, there are no connections to the USB port's 5 V rail. This limitation is primarily due to the high current draw of the Pro: while powering the touchscreen running and an external target, it would be easy to exceed the USB current limit, causing all sorts of issues.

To make this setup more flexible, the Pro ships with two power sources:
* A 5 V, 2.1 A power supply. This supply is suitable for a permanent bench setup.
* A USB-to-barrel jack cable. This solution is more portable: if you're travelling with a laptop, you can use a second USB port for power. A USB charger will also work here.
If you're using the USB power cable, it is recommended to use a separate power supply to power any external target boards.

= Basic Usage =
The basic features on the Pro are exactly the same as the ChipWhisperer Lite. This means that any scripts and tutorials made for the Lite will work on the Pro, too: the connectors and pinouts are exactly the same.

= Touchscreen =
The touchscreen on the ChipWhisperer Pro shows various details about its status and current settings.

== Screen 1: Clock ==
The clock screen shows the status of the CLKGEN and ADC clocks along with the frequency counter. 

'''TODO: picture'''
* '''CLKGEN''': Current frequency of CLKGEN clock in kHz
** '''Source''': Input to CLKGEN DCM. Could be system clock or EXTCLK
** '''DCM''': Lock status of CLKGEN DCM
** '''Reset DCM''': Reset the CLKGEN output. Useful if clock has locked at the wrong frequency
* '''ADC Clock''': Current ADC sampling rate in kHz
** '''Source''': Input to ADC DCM. Could be related to CLKGEN or EXTCLK
** '''DCM''': Lock status of ADC DCM
** '''Reset DCM''': Reset the ADC clock output
* '''Frequency Counter''': Current frequency measured by the frequency counter
** '''Source''': Input to frequency counter. Could be either EXTCLK or CLKGEN

== Screen 2: Routing ==
The routing screen shows the status of the various I/O pins.

'''TODO: picture'''
* '''Aux Output''': Status of the aux SMA connections. Could be used as trigger input/output, glitch output, and/or clock output
* '''IO Pins''': Status of each of the IO pins on the 20 pin connector. Possible values depend on pin
* '''Target Power State''': Status of the 3.3 V output. Can be toggled here to reset target
* '''Target HS IO-Out''': Signal connected to high-speed output (HS2). Could be CLKGEN, glitch module, or disabled

== Screen 3: Trigger ==
The trigger screen shows the current settings for the trigger module and the ADC capture settings.

'''TODO: picture'''
* '''Trigger Pins''': Whether each trigger input is enabled. Active inputs are highlighted
** '''Mode''': Trigger combination method. Could be AND, OR, or NAND
* '''Trigger Source''': The trigger type in use. Active trigger module is highlighted
** '''State''': The current output level of the trigger module
* '''Trigger Mode''': The ADC trigger type. Active mode is highlighted
* '''Samples''':
** '''Delay''': Current ADC offset. This is the number of samples to wait after trigger before recording begins
** '''Pre''': Number of pre-trigger samples to be saved
** '''Time''': Delay, but converted into a time
** '''Total''': Number of samples to be recorded in total
* '''ADC gain''':
** '''Mode''': Amplification type. Either low or high
** '''Setting''': Low noise amplifier gain level

== Screen 4: Glitch ==
The glitch screen shows the current settings for the glitch module.

'''TODO: picture'''
* '''Clock Src''': Input to the glitch module's clock. Active clock is highlighted
** '''DCM''': Lock status of the glitch module's DCM
* '''Glitch Setup''':
** '''Width''': Duty cycle of glitch pulse, as a fraction of one period
** '''Fine''': Adjustment on width
** '''Offset''': Distance between clock rising edge and glitch pulse rising edge, as a fraction of one period
** '''Fine''': Adjustment on offset
* '''View''': Schematic of glitch clock. Shows regular clock above (blue) and glitch module output below (black)
* '''Trigger Src''': Input for glitch module. Active source is highlighted
* '''Trigger Setup''':
** '''Trigger''': Cause a manual trigger. Has no effect unless trigger source is set to Manual
** '''Offset''': Number of cycles to wait before starting glitch pulses
** '''Repeat''': Number of consecutive pulses to generate
* '''Output Status'''
** '''VCC''': Status of glitching MOSFETs. Shows warning sign if VCC glitching is enabled
** '''Cnt''': Total number of glitch pulses generated
