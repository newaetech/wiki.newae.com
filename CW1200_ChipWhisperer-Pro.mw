The CW1200 (ChipWhisperer Pro) is an upgraded version of the ChipWhisperer Lite capture hardware. The Pro includes an FPGA with much more space than the Lite, allowing many new features to be added, including a larger sample buffer, streaming-mode captures, additional trigger methods, and a touchscreen interface. These features make it a high-end device suitable for laboratory use.

Check out a [https://youtu.be/qS6JwX4SBOI sneak peek of the CW-Pro].

= Connection Quick-Start =

<ol>
<li>Follow the [[Installing ChipWhisperer]] instructions for the ChipWhisperer software and its prerequisites.</li>
<li>Connect ChipWhisperer-Lite, install USB Drivers:
<dl>
<dt>Windows:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Plug micro-USB cable into ChipWhisperer-Lite</li>
<li>If the &quot;New Hardware Found&quot; wizard doesn't prompt you for drivers, go to the control panel and find the &quot;ChipWhisperer-Pro&quot; device, and select "Update Drivers".</li>
<li>You can find drivers in <code>c:\chipwhisperer\hardware\capture\chipwhisperer-cw1200\</code>. You will likely need to extract them from the <code>cw1200_usbdriver.zip</code> file. If so simply extract them somewhere (i.e. your desktop), and then point the new hardware found wizard to that location.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>Linux:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Driver installation is not required, but if you do not update the 'udev' system, you will be unable to run ChipWhisperer-Capture as a regular user. To update the udev system, first make sure the ChipWhisperer-Lite is Make a file called <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-cwlite.rules</code> . The contents of this file should be:</p>
<pre># allow users to claim the device
SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;2b3e&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;ace3&quot;, MODE=&quot;0664&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;</pre></li>
<li><p>Add your username to the plugdev group:</p>
<pre>$ sudo usermod -a -G plugdev YOUR-USERNAME</pre></li>
<li><p>And reset the udev system:</p>
<pre>$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules</pre></li>
<li>Finally log out &amp; in again for the group change to take effect.</li>
<li>Connect the USB-A cable, and DC power cable</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>MAC:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>No special installation required - must ensure you have installed libusb via homebrew (see instructions at [[MacOSX_Installation]]).</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</li>
<li><p>To check for a successful installation Run ChipWhisperer-Capture. This can be done from one of three ways:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Double-click on <code>CWCapture.pyw</code> in the <code>chipwhisperer\software</code> folder. You must have installed Python into your path for this to work.</li>
<li>run <code>python CWCapture.pyw</code> from the <code>chipwhisperer\software</code> folder using a command prompt with Python in the path.</li>
<li>run <code>python CWCaptureGUI.py</code> from the <code>chipwhisperer\software\chipwhisperer\capture\ui</code> directory.</li></ul>

<p>The last option is the most reliable, in that it should always work on all platforms. If it doesn't start look for possible missing modules or other useful errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<li>Your ChipWhisperer-Lite is now connected. See the Tutorial B-1 for details of the demo attack.</li>
</li></ol>


= Power Supply =
The ChipWhisperer Pro can only be powered through its 5 V jack. It cannot be powered through the USB port - internally, there are no connections to the USB port's 5 V rail. This limitation is primarily due to the high current draw of the Pro: while powering the touchscreen running and an external target, it would be easy to exceed the USB current limit, causing all sorts of issues.

To make this setup more flexible, the Pro ships with two power sources:
* A 5 V, 2.1 A power supply. This supply is suitable for a permanent bench setup.
* A USB-to-barrel jack cable. This solution is more portable: if you're travelling with a laptop, you can use a second USB port for power. A USB charger will also work here.
If you're using the USB power cable, it is recommended to use a separate power supply to power any external target boards.

= Basic Usage =
The basic features on the Pro are exactly the same as the ChipWhisperer Lite. This means that any scripts and tutorials made for the Lite will work on the Pro, too: the connectors and pinouts are exactly the same.
