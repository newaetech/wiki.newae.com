== I/O Connections ==

The pinout of this module matches the "NOTDuino" kit along with the "CW301 Multi-Target Board" routing. The following is the connection between GPIO1-4 and the I/O lines on the AVR:

!CW308 Pin
!ATMega328P Pin
!Notes
|-
|GPIO1
|PD0 (RXD)
|Serial INPUT to AVR.
|-
|GPIO2
|PD1 (TXD)
|Serial OUTPUT from AVR.
|-
|GPIO3
|N/C
|
|-
|GPIO4
|PC0
|Trigger pin (mapped to ADC-port such that I/O driver power comes from AVCC).

|-
|CLKFB
|PB0
|Can set this pin as CLKO with fuse. Useful for synchronizing to internal RC oscillator.

|nRST
|nRST (PC6)
|Used by in-system-programming (ISP) interface.
|-
|MOSI
|PB3 (MOSI)
|Used by in-system-programming (ISP) interface.
|-
|MISO
|PB4 (MISO)
|Used by in-system-programming (ISP) interface.
|-
|SCK
|PB5 (SCK)
|Used by in-system-programming (ISP) interface.

== Programming Header ==

The 6-pin programming heading can be used with the Atmel ISP interface. The pinout of the 6-pin programming header on the main-board allows it to work with standard Atmel ISP tools:
