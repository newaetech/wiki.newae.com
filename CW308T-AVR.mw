== I/O Connections ==

The pinout of this module matches the "NOTDuino" kit along with the "CW301 Multi-Target Board" routing. The following is the connection between GPIO1-4 and the I/O lines on the AVR:

|-
|GPIO1
|PD0 (RXD)
|Serial INPUT to AVR.
|-
|GPIO2
|PD1 (TXD)
|Serial OUTPUT from AVR.
|-
|GPIO3
|N/C

== Programming Header ==

The 6-pin programming heading can be used with the Atmel ISP interface. The pinout of the 6-pin programming header on the main-board allows it to work with standard Atmel ISP tools:
