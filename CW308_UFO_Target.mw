The CW308 UFO Board is a handy main-board for attacking all sorts of embedded targets. Released in 2016, it forms the basis for most of our upcoming target boards. It can be used stand-alone (with an oscilloscope) or with the ChipWhisperer-Capture hardware.

== Overview ==

== Victim Board Connectors ==

The "victim board" fits into three 20-pin female headers. They provide both electrical and mechanical connections for the board. There is optional mounting holes which can be used if additional mechanical support is required (especially if you need a locked-down victim for use with an EM probe).

The following shows the dimensions of the main connector:

=== Removing / Replacing Victim Boards ===

The target board is removed and replaced using the removal tool. This helps avoid bending pins:

[[File:P1090067.jpg|400px]]

The following shows the removal process:

[[File:removal.gif]]

Adding a board involves carefully aligning the board and pushing down:

[[File:addition.gif]]

The alignment should be carefully checked if resistance is found. You may need to adjust how the board is aligned, as you should be able to press down with minimal force.

The CW308 should be turned off when swapping victim boards.

== I/O Connections ==

There are two main I/O connection points: the pin headers which duplicate the target board connections, and the 20-pin ChipWhisperer header.

The ChipWhisperer header pins (most of the pins on header J5) have diode protection to set a maximum voltage level. The maximum voltage is set by the voltage present on the middle pin of J4.
