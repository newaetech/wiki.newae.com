The CW308 UFO Board is a handy main-board for attacking all sorts of embedded targets. Released in 2016, it forms the basis for most of our upcoming target boards. It can be used stand-alone (with an oscilloscope) or with the ChipWhisperer-Capture hardware.

== Overview ==

[[File:cw308_fpga.png]]
[[File:cw308_top.png|700px]]

== Supported Targets ==

Details of the targets are held on their own wiki page. Some targets are available premade, but all have gerber files in the GIT repo so you can build them yourself.

* [[CW308T-GENERIC]] (Protoboard)
* [[CW308T-AVR]] (Atmel AVR, 8-bit)
* [[CW308T-XMEGA]] (Atmel XMEGA, 8-bit)
* [[CW308T-87C51]] (Intel 87C51RB, 8-bit)
* [[CW308T-ATSAMR21]] (Atmel SAMR21 with 802.15.4 radio, 32-bit ARM Cortex M0)
* [[CW308T-MEGARF]] (Atmel MegaRF2564RFR2, 8-bit AVR)
* [[CW308T-MSP430FR5]] (TI MSP430FR5xxx, 16-bit)
* [[CW308T-S6LX9]] (Xilinx Spartan 6 LX9 in TQFP, FPGA)

If you need to support a new target, it's generally very simple to build a custom board.

== Victim Board Connectors ==

The "victim board" fits into three 20-pin female headers. They provide both electrical and mechanical connections for the board. There is optional mounting holes which can be used if additional mechanical support is required (especially if you need a locked-down victim for use with an EM probe).

The following shows the dimensions of the main connector:

[[File:CW308_victim_dims.png|518x518px|The CW308 victim board has contacts on a 100 mil spacing, allowing you to use regular prototype boards. Click for full size.|none|thumb]]

Note the middle mounting hole is slightly offset to one direction! This was done to keep the mounting hole on a 100-mil grid spacing.

=== Removing / Replacing Victim Boards ===

The target board is removed and replaced using the removal tool. This helps avoid bending pins:

[[File:P1090067.jpg|400px]]

The following shows the removal process:

[[File:removal.gif]]

Adding a board involves carefully aligning the board and pushing down:

[[File:addition.gif]]

The alignment should be carefully checked if resistance is found. You may need to adjust how the board is aligned, as you should be able to press down with minimal force.

The CW308 should be turned off when swapping victim boards.

== I/O Connections ==

There are two main I/O connection points: the pin headers which duplicate the target board connections, and the 20-pin ChipWhisperer header.

The ChipWhisperer header pins (most of the pins on header J5) have diode protection to set a maximum voltage level. The maximum voltage is set by the voltage present on the middle pin of J4.

=== VREF Level Setting ===

The on-board 'VREF' network sets the reference voltage to allow usage with multiple I/O levels. Note there are no voltage translators on-board, instead you can use the [CW506 Advanced Breakout Board] to provide voltage translation. One of the pins on the 20-pin connector outputs the reference voltage (VREF), so the CW506 knows what voltage level to translate I/O signals to.

The on-board crystal oscillator is powered from the VREF network, ensuring the on-board oscillator is at an appropriate voltage reference.

The I/O pins connected to the 20-pin header have diode clamping, with the maximum level set by the VREF network. You must ensure jumper J4 sets a correct reference level. If using any of the official victim boards this is done by setting J4 to receive it's reference level from "J5-VREF" pin.

{{Infobox|If you do NOT set a correct VREF level, the diode clamps will pull I/O pins down to invalid levels. If you are using the prototyping board be sure to connect pin A20 (the 'VREF' pin) on the victim connector strip to the desired I/O level!}}

== Clock Network ==

=== Crystal Driver ===

The CW308 contains a crystal oscillator driver. This allows you to use a standard crystal to drive either the victim board or the connected ChipWhisperer. This also allows the use of the CW308 stand-alone, as it's possible to generate almost any frequency by simply putting an appropriate crystal into the socket.

[[File:P1090074.jpg|border|frameless|400x400px]]

=== Clock Selection ===

The clock routing is selected using jumper J3. This allows the following use cases:
* Routing crystal oscillator (X1) to victim CLKIN.
* Routing crystal oscillator (X1) to ChipWhisperer HS-IN, then routing HS-OUT to victim CLKIN (for glitch insertion).
* Routing CLKFB from victim to ChipWhisperer HS-IN.
* Routing ChipWhisperer HS-OUT to victim CLKIN.

[[File:cw308_clockrouting.png|400px]]

== Power Distribution ==
The following shows the routing of power to the victim board:

[[File:cw308_switch.png|600px]]

The following summarizes the switch information:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|S1
|Switch 5.0V from DC-Power Jack On/Off
|Lower Left
|Selects if DC 5.0V from DC-Jack is "always on", or gets gated by 3.3V source from 20-pin connector ('auto'). If 'auto' mode selected and no 20-pin cable connected, this is equivalent to turning the main supply to the board on/off. Thus when using the board stand-alone S1 acts as a power switch for the board.
|-

|-
|S2
|Choose 3.3V source to connect to victim board.
|
|Select 3.3V from 20-pin ChipWhisperer cable, or local LDO.
|}

=== External Power Sources ===

There are two main sources to supply power to the CW308:

* DC-input power jack (2.1mm barrel jack, center positive, 5.0V)
* ChipWhisperer 20-pin connector (5.0V and 3.3V).

Note you can use the DC-input power jack alongside the ChipWhisperer power supply. The CW308 can switch the DC-power on/off, allowing the ChipWhisperer to still control the target power.

If using the board stand-alone, you can use the 3.3V pin of the CW20 pin to turn on/off the board remotely. This pin can be used as a digital input, which will turn on/off the 5.0V power jack. Be sure to switch all regulators to use the 5.0V DC-Jack in this case to avoid having a load on the 3.3V pin.

=== On-Board LDOs ===

There are five LDOs on-board the CW308. While they are mostly rated for 800mA, the board does not have sufficient thermal dissipation to operate at these conditions.

Four of the LDOs have fixed voltage settings: 1.2V, 1.8V, 2.5V, and 3.3V. The fifth LDO is adjustable, and is especially useful if you need to either (a) overcome the voltage drop of a shunt, or (b) feed a power supply into a device to turn off an internal regulator.

=== Adjustable Voltage Example ===

== Power Filter ==

The CW308 contains a L-C low-pass filter. This filter is designed to provide a highly filtered version of the power supply to the victim board. The various voltages on the victim board power headers can be directly routed to the various required power pins. For example if your device has an on-board PLL, this power supply is something we do not need to measure as part of the power analysis.

The "core" voltage supply for the device should first be fed through the on-board filter. This is accomplished by feeding the desired voltage (for example a 1.8V supply) into the "FILT" pin (pin C8). The output of the filter will be present on the FILT_LP and FILT_HP pins. You can then feed this through your shunt resistor, and finally to the core voltage of the device being measured.

Note jumper J14 can be used to override the filter input voltage. This override can come from the adjustable regulator as previously mentioned.

== Programmer Connections ==

There are several headers that can be used as programming headers for the victim board. These are J10, J12, an J15. They are routed to pins 10 to 20 (H1 to H10) on the victim board connector J9. These connectors function is defined by the specific victim board mounted.

[[File:cw308_programming.png]]

In addition there is a 20-pin JTAG header. This uses the standard JTAG ARM pinout.

== Usage Example: Stand-Alone ==

The CW308 can be used stand-alone. This is accomplished by providing an external DC power supply, and using a SMA-BNC to connect the voltage measurement to an oscilloscope.

If using a simple-serial target (such as the XMEGA or AVR), you can connect a USB-Serial device to provide communication.
